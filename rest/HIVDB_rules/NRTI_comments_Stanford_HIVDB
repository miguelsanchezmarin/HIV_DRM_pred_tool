40F,NRTI,"E40F is a non-polymorphic accessory mutation selected by AZT and d4T. It usually occurs in combination with M41L, L210W and T215Y. In this context it is associated with reduced susceptibility to each of the NRTIs."
41L,NRTI,"M41L is a TAM that usually occurs with T215Y. In combination, M41L plus T215Y confer intermediate / high-level resistance to AZT and d4T and contribute to reduced ddI, ABC and TDF susceptibility."
44AD,NRTI,E44D is a relatively non-polymorphic accessory mutation; E44A is a nonpolymorphic accessory mutation. Each usually occurs with multiple TAMs.
62V,NRTI,A62V is an accessory mutation that often occurs in combination with the multi-NRTI resistance mutations K65R or Q151M. A62V is widespread in subtype A viruses in former Soviet Union countries but A62 is otherwise non-polymorphic.
65E,NRTI,"K65R confers intermediate reductions in susceptibility to TDF, ABC, and 3TC/FTC. It increases AZT susceptibility. K65E is an extremely rare NRTI-selected mutation with markedly reduced replication fitness. Its effect on NRTI susceptibility is uncertain."
65N,NRTI,"K65R confers intermediate reductions in susceptibility to TDF, ABC, and 3TC/FTC. It increases AZT susceptibility. K65N appears to have reduced replication compared with K65R."
65R,NRTI,"K65R confers intermediate reductions in susceptibility to TDF, ABC, and 3TC/FTC. Other than M184VI, it is the most common DRM emerging in patients receiving TDF/XTC. K65R increases AZT susceptibility. In NRTI-experienced, INSTI-naive patients with K65R, TDF/3TC/DTG is usually highly effective and more effective than AZT/3TC/DTG. However, in patients receiving TDF/3TC/DTG, there is a risk of emergent DTG resistance that does not arise in NRTI-naive patients receiving TDF/3TC/DTG."
67d OR 68d OR 69d OR 70d,Other,"Amino acid deletions between codons 67 and 70 are rare and usually occur in combination with multiple TAMs, K65R, or the Q151M mutation complex. Deletions at position 67 are more often associated with multiple TAMs. Deletions at positions 69 and 70 are more often associated with K65R or the Q151M mutation complex. Deletions at codon 68 are extremely rare and less well characterized."
67GESTH,NRTI,D67N is a non-polymorphic TAM associated with low-level resistance to AZT. D67G/E/S/T/H are non-polymorphic NRTI-selected mutations that generally occur in viruses with multiple TAMs.
67N,NRTI,D67N is a non-polymorphic TAM associated with low-level resistance to AZT.
68G,NRTI,S68G is a polymorphic mutation that is often selected in combination with K65R. It partially restores the replication defect associated with K65R.
68DNR,NRTI,S68DNR are nonpolymorphic mutations that are selected by TDF. They appear to increase viral fitness and/or further reduce TDF susceptibility when they occur in combination with K65R.
69D,NRTI,"T69D is a nonpolymorphic mutation selected by early NRTIs that does not appear to reduce AZT, ABC, or TDF susceptibility."
69G,NRTI,T69G is a rare non-polymorphic mutation that usually occurs in viruses with a deletion at codon 67 and multiple other NRTI-resistance mutations.
69i,Other,"Amino acid insertions between codons 67 and 70 are by convention assigned to codon 69. Together with TAMs, they are associated with high-level resistance to AZT, ABC and TDF, and intermediate to 3TC and FTC."
69NSAIE,Other,T69N/S/A/I/E are relatively non-polymorphic mutations weakly selected in persons receiving NRTIs. They may minimally contribute reduced AZT susceptibility.
70EGQNST,NRTI,K70/E/Q/N/T/S/G cause low-leve resistance to ABC and TDF.
70R,NRTI,K70R is a TAM that confers intermediate resistance to AZT and contributes to reduced ABC and TDF susceptibility in combination with other TAMs.
74VI,NRTI,L74V causes intermediate ABC resistance. L74I causes low-level ABC resistance.
75I,NRTI,"V75I is a relatively non-polymorphic accessory mutation that often occurs in combination with the multi-NRTI resistance mutation Q151M. When it occurs alone, its clinical significance is uncertain."
75MTAS,NRTI,"V75T/M/A/S are nonpolymorphic accessory NRTI-selected mutations. They appear to have minimal phenotypic effects on AZT, ABC, and TDF."
77L,NRTI,"F77L usually occurs in combination with the multi-NRTI resistance mutation Q151M. When it occurs alone, its clinical significance is uncertain."
115F,NRTI,Y115F causes intermediate resistance to ABC and low-level resistance to TDF.
116Y,NRTI,"F116Y usually occurs in combination with the multi-NRTI resistance mutation Q151M. When it occurs alone, its clinical significance is unknown."
118I,Other,V118I is a polymorphic accessory NRTI-resistance mutation that often occurs in combination with multiple TAMs.
151L,NRTI,"Q151M causes intermediate/high-level resistance to AZT and ABC, and low-level resistance to TDF, 3TC and FTC. In combination with two or more accessory mutations at positions 62, 75, 77, and 116, it confers high-level resistance to AZT and ABC and intermediate resistance to TDF, 3TC and FTC. Q151L is an extremely rare transitional mutation that may precede the emergence of the Q151M."
151M,NRTI,"Q151M causes intermediate/high-level resistance to AZT and ABC, and low-level resistance to TDF, 3TC and FTC. In combination with two or more accessory mutations at positions 62, 75, 77, and 116, it confers high-level resistance to AZT and ABC and intermediate resistance to TDF, 3TC and FTC."
184VI,NRTI,M184V/I cause high-level in vitro resistance to 3TC and FTC and low/intermediate resistance to ABC (3-fold reduced susceptibility). M184V/I are not contraindications to continued treatment with 3TC or FTC because they increase susceptibility to AZT and TDF and are associated with clinically significant reductions in HIV-1 replication.
210W,NRTI,"L210W is a TAM that usually occurs in combination with M41L and T215Y. The combination of M41, L210W and T215Y causes high-level resistance to AZT and intermediate resistance to ABC and TDF."
215SCDEIVALN,NRTI,T215Y/F are TAMs that causes intermediate/high-level resistance to AZT and potentially low-level resistance to ABC and TDF. T215S/C/D/E/I/V/N/A/L do not reduce NRTI susceptibility but arise from viruses that once contained T215Y/F. The presence of one of these revertant mutations suggests that the patient may have once been infected with a virus containing T215Y/F.
215YF,NRTI,T215Y/F are TAMs that causes intermediate/high-level resistance to AZT and potentially low-level resistance to ABC and TDF.
219EQNR,NRTI,K219E/Q/N/R are accessory TAMS that usually occur in combination with multiple other TAMs.
219W,NRTI,K219E/Q/N/R are accessory TAMS that usually occur in combination with multiple other TAMs. K219W is an uncommon NRTI-selected mutation.
